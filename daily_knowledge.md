### UDF
#### Why UDF is Slow ?
- Py4J helps to connect the JVM & Python runtime, so if there are native or SQL spark transformation, they will be executed in JVM.
- Howerver, UDF code cannot be executed in JVM, because the UDF code is python-based, so only can run in Python runtime of the worker nodes and return the data to JVM
  - Therefore, each row of the data will be serialized and sent to Python runtime to transformed via UDF and return to JVM

Solution: Apache Arrow, or write UDF in native languages (Scala or Java)
